Hello, World! This is my first of hopefully many posts that will paint a picture of my journey to becoming a Software Engineer. To keep this brief, I graduated just a few years ago with a degree in Accounting which I never planned to use. My original thought was to study something technical that would equip me with a sense of understanding through every channel of the business process. I was the first to attend college in my family and also pursue business, so into the abyss I went. I've always had a creative mind and in my eyes if I paired that with the understanding of business functions, laws and parameters, then I could operate within these realms and excercise my creative thinking to optimize my value within any given role. 

With this framework in mind, I paired on several occassions with various talented people both within my University and outside on several projects that were exciting and very difficult. The first was an app that we actually raised a seed round for but ultimately it crashed and burned, mainly because all three of us that were driving this idea had no skill in software development or managing a dev project. That project failing taught me more than what I learned in undergrad. For the second venture, I was riding the excitment from the first and wanted to dive right into something new. Instead of taking a step back and finding a technical partner or learning some of these core skills myself I just chose a simpler business model. The business is still living (barely) but again, I had to find devs to program it, maintain it and I put a lot of risk into the chance of them vanishing and having to start fresh with another engineer. 

Essentially, this boils down to the why. My why at this point is to truly slow down and dig deep into development, what it means to me, how it's applied and the opportunities it wields. Whether I excersise this knowledge for work, side projects or a charity, I am excited to learn and contribute were I can.
